Depending on the student’s/our loaner computers, if they don’t have a usb-c port, we might want a few of these handy (but likely don’t need them per student): [adapters](https://www.amazon.com/Elebase-Upgraded-Connector-Chargers-Interface/dp/B07LF72431)

Assembly of some of the parts requires soldering pins on (especially depending on the SKU or exact vendor you buy from). Also, the speakers come with 1.25mm JST headers, but to make it more breadboard friendly, I replaced those with dupont connectors (e.g. [these ones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B11RLGDZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)).
