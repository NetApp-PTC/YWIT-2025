The project box/case that all of the parts are contained in was designed using Fusion 360. The source .f3d file is located in this directory. It was additionally exported as a .step to be used in other CAD programs if desired.

The case was then 3d-printed. The .3mf is exported below as well as the .stl for importing into your slicer of choice.
