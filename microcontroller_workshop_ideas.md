Ideas for 2025 microcontroller workshop
===

* Roll a die
  - Uses a 7 segment display to show the die roll

  - Perhaps an implementation of Pig: https://www.dicegamedepot.com/dice-n-games-blog/pig-dice-game-rules/

* Light up a row of LEDs
  - Uses a rotary encoder to choose one of the states

  - Could also potentially use the 7 segment display to display digits 0-9 as the encoder changes. Use the button to do something after selection?

* Wave a flag
  - Uses a servo (might require an external power supply unless it was a very low power one, or maybe just a capacitor?)

* Blow out some candles
  - Uses s microphone and some LEDs that you can blow out if you blow hard enough or just dim if it's soft
